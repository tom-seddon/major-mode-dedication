major-mode-dedication
=====================

This package lets you dedicate a major mode to a particular emacs
window. Any time you - or emacs - try to display a buffer with that
major mode, it will appear in its dedicated window. You can dedicate
multiple major modes to the same window, and all appropriate buffers
will appear in that window (one at a time...). And you can dedicate
the same major mode to multiple windows, in which case a sensible
window will be chosen each time.

This behaviour is intended for use with singleton-type buffers such as
=*compilation*=, =*scratch*=, =*Messages*=, =*grep*=, =*Help*= and so
on, that you might want to have appear in a particular location rather
than popping up in some random window and replacing something
important.

And being based on major mode rather than particular buffer, it can
also be useful for things like [[https://github.com/Wilfred/ag.el][ag-mode]] or shell mode (which pop up
multiple buffers, all with the same major mode).

installation
============

Clone the github repo. Then, in your .emacs, set up =load-path=,
=require= the package, and call =mmd-install= (this package isn't a
minor mode) to set it up. Something like:

: (add-to-list 'load-path "~/github/major-mode-dedication")
: (require 'major-mode-dedication)
: (mmd-install)

=mmd-install= tries to set up a special major-mode-dedication keymap
with the prefix =C-x D=. If this key combo is already used, it does
nothing, in which case I'm afraid you're on your own.

use (interactive)
=================

When you've got a buffer of a particular mode displayed in a window
where you like it, do =M-x mmd-set-major-mode-window-dedication=, or
=C-x D D=. This will dedicate that window to buffers with that major
mode. (To remove the dedication, use a prefix argument - =C-u C-x D
D=.)

You can "dedicate" a window to more than one major mode - this just
means multiple types of buffer will appear in the same window, each
one hiding the one that was previously shown there.

You can use =M-x mmd-show-major-mode-window-dedication=, or =C-x D
S=, to show the current window's major mode dedication as a message.

use (elisp)
===========

From elisp, there are two non-interactive functions you can call:
=mmd-add-major-mode-window-dedication=, and
=mmd-remove-major-mode-window-dedication=. Both take a major mode name
and a window, and add (or remove) the major mode to the window's list.

These are intended for use in functions that set up some kind of
standard window arrangement.

open issues
===========

- If you pop up a buffer that's dedicated to a window in another
  frame, and that frame is obscured, you don't see anything. There
  must be something better that could be done.

- Probably many others that I haven't found yet/have just become used
  to...
